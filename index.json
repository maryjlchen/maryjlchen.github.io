However, due to their synthetic origin, polymeric materials still face issues regarding hemocompatibility. This underscores the need for the investigation of methods to improve the hemocompatibility of polymeric materials. In this research, we report on the effect of crystallinity on hemolysis, thrombogenicity, and platelet adhesion in polyetheretherketone (PEEK) surfaces, acknowledging the vast potential of PEEK on cardiovascular device design. To improve properties of implantable cardiovascular devices, the effect of crystallinity on the hemocompatibility of PEEK surfaces is investigated. After annealing at different temperatures, the chemical composition and concentration of different functional groups is determined through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The resulting change in hemolytic activity, thrombogenicity, and platelet adhesion is observed by standardized hemocompatibility test, alongside changes in mechanical properties such as tensile modulus and toughness. Higher crystallinity results in increased abundance of oxygen-containing surface functional groups. This increase of negatively charged surface functional groups causes significant reductions in the hemolysis (1.57 to 0.75% cm-2), thrombin generation rate (4840 to 1586 mU mL-1 min-1 cm-2), and platelet adhesion (31.9 to 1.5%). Further, optimized tensile toughness can be accomplished at a moderate crystallinity, with acceptable hemocompatibility indexes. Our results show that crystalline PEEK is highly blood compatible in all test categories. Our results also show that this increase in hemocompatibility can be accompanied by an optimization in the tensile modulus and toughness. Hence, crystallization is shown to be a simple and effective method to improve compatibility with blood and mechanical performance of PEEK used for cardiovascular implants","tags":[],"title":"Tailoring PEEK Crystallinity: Key For Highly Hemocompatible And Mechanically Performing Cardiovascular Implants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mary Jialu Chen","Arthur Schlothauer","Georgios Pappas","Nikola Cesarovic","Volkmar Falk","Paolo Ermanni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"d217e2201a60e77b3f53ff9ad0477f21","permalink":"https://maryjlchen.github.io/publication/nanobiotech2021/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nanobiotech2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

While significant research has emerged in the last few years devoted to MoS2 and graphene-MoS2 hybrid electrode systems, little is known regarding fundamental double-layer charging mechanisms in this system. In this work, we determine the potential and frequency dependent area-specific double-layer capacitance of the electrode/electrolyte interface using the 1T and 2H polymorphs of MoS2. Furthermore, we aim to understand restacking effects and possible intercalation mechanisms in multilayer MoS2 films, as well as how the intrinsic capacitance can be enhanced by defect engineering. To by-pass the challenges and uncertainties associated with porous electrodes, we carry out measurements on non-porous monolayer electrodes supported by atomically flat graphite single crystals. Monolayer films were prepared by using a variation of the Langmuir Blodgett deposition method to create films of chemically exfoliated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and chemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO) using a recently developed barrier-free densification method. The films were characterized to determine surface coverage, surface roughness, layer number and electrode material chemistry. The frequency and voltage-dependent capacitance of monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer films were measured by cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the metallic 1T polymorph of MoS2 (Ca,1T = 14.9 µF/cm2) has over tenfold the capacitance of the semiconducting 2H polymorph (Ca,2H = 1.35 µF/cm2) near the open circuit potential and under negative polarization in aqueous electrolyte. However, under positive polarization the capacitance is significantly reduced and behaves similarly to the 2H polymorph. While the capacitance of rGO films does not increase with increasing layer number, the capacitance of 1T-MoS2 films scaled with layer number, even at high frequency, suggesting easy and rapid ion intercalation between the restacked sheets. The results of these studies allow us to determine the limiting factors and upper limits of capacitance expected from MoS2 composites and provides engineering design criteria for building higher performance MoS2 composite electrodes. Furthermore, in order to extend the potential upper capacitance limits of MoS2 supercapacitors, defect engineering is explored in MoS2 nanosheet films. Two types of defects are introduced into MoS2 - sulfur vacancies and edge sites. Sulfur vacancies are created by increasing the amount of lithium intercalant used while edge sites are produced simply by decreasing the lateral size of MoS2 nanosheets through sonication. When transitioning from 0% to 6.6% sulfur vacancies, the intrinsic capacitance increases consistently. Conversely, while decreasing flake size by 40 nm increases the measured capacitance, further size reduction by 80 nm results in decreased capacitance. These results demonstrate that defect engineering through careful tuning of MoS2 nanosheet synthesis allows for considerable improvements to the intrinsic capacitance.","tags":[],"title":"Intrinsic Capacitance, Charge Storage Mechanisms, and Defect Engineering of Molybdenum Disulfide Nanosheets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mary Jialu Chen","Wesley R.

For these procedures to succeed, the amount of heat generated by the laser at the point of contact must be carefully monitored, and there is currently no way to do this reliably. To this end we propose the use of molecular beacon probes with temperature-dependent fluorescence properties. These probes, encased in a gel matrix to be representative of the human eye, will act as an accurate, real time, non-invasive temperature sensor. Our design consists of a frequency-regulated system in which fluorescence is extracted from the probes and converted into a real-time temperature signal.

The MF coating was critical for the uniform generation and size-control of MNPs. The contribution of MF resin to optimal MNP synthesis includes (1) increased surface area with its spongelike structure, (2) enhanced affinity to metals through chelation with nitrogen functionalities, and (3) effective MNP size control due to the mesoporous structure. The MNP/MFCNC system significantly improved catalytic activity as demonstrated by the reduction of 4-nitrophenol with Pd/MFCNCs with a turnover frequency of 3168 h -1 .
