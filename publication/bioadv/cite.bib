abstract = {Polymers have the potential to replace metallic or bioprosthetic heart valve components due to superior durability and inertness while allowing for natural tissue-like flexibility. Despite these appealing properties, certain polymers such as polyetheretherketone (PEEK) have issues with hemocompatibility, which many complex approaches have been investigated to overcome. In this paper, we explore the enhancement of PEEK hemocompatibility with polymer crystallinity. Amorphous, semi-crystalline and crystalline PEEK are investigated in addition to a highly crystalline carbon fiber (CF)/PEEK composite material (CFPEEK). The functional group density of the PEEK samples is determined, showing that higher crystallinity results in increased amount of surface carbonyl functional groups. The increase of crystallinity (and negatively charged groups) appears to cause significant reductions in platelet adhesion (33.0 vs. 1.5 % surface coverage), hemolysis (1.55 vs. 0.75 % cm−2), and thrombin generation rate (4840 vs. 1585 mU/mL/min/cm2). In combination with the hemocompatibility study, mechanical characterization demonstrates that tailoring crystallinity is a simple and effective method to control both hemocompatibility and mechanical performance of PEEK. Furthermore, the results display that CFPEEK composite performed very well in all categories due to its enhanced crystallinity and complete carbon encapsulation, allowing the unique properties of CFPEEK to empower new concepts in cardiovascular device design.}
